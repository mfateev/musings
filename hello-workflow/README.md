# Temporal Python Hello World Sample

This sample demonstrates the most basic Temporal workflow pattern using Python. It shows how to:

- Define a simple workflow that returns a greeting message
- Create a worker to execute workflows
- Start a workflow execution from a client

## Components

### 1. Workflow (`workflow.py`)
- **HelloWorldWorkflow**: A simple workflow class that returns a personalized greeting
- Demonstrates the basic `@workflow.defn` and `@workflow.run` decorators
- Takes a name parameter and returns "Hello {name}!" string

### 2. Worker (`worker.py`)
- Connects to the Temporal service
- Registers the HelloWorldWorkflow
- Polls the `hello-world-task-queue` for workflow tasks
- Executes workflow instances when tasks are available

### 3. Starter (`starter.py`)
- Creates a Temporal client connection
- Starts a new workflow execution with ID `hello-world-workflow-001`
- Waits for workflow completion and prints the result

## Sequence Diagram

The following diagram shows the interaction flow between components:

    participant W as Workflow Worker
    
    Note over S,W: Prerequisites: Temporal service running, Worker started
    
    S->>+TS: StartWorkflowExecution<br/> (HellowWorldWorkflow, TaskQueue: hellow-world-task-queue, ID: hello-world-workflow-001, Input:"Temporal")
    TS-->>-S: Ack
        
    W->>TS: long-poll PollWorkflowTaskQueue (hello-world-task-queue)
    
    TS->>+W: WorkflowTask<br/>(HellowWorldWorkflow, ID: hello-world-workflow-001, Input:"Temporal")
    W->>W: Execute HelloWorldWorkflow.run("Temporal")
    W->>W: return "Hello Temporal!"
    W-->>-TS: CompleteWorkflowTask(Commands:[<br/>CompleteWorkflowExecution(Result:"Hello Temporal!")<br/>])
    Note over S,W: Workflow execution complete
    
    S->>+TS: long-poll GetResult
    TS-->>-S: Return result: "Hello Temporal!"
    
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Workflow Definition
- **Workflow Decorator**: `@workflow.defn` marks the class as a Temporal workflow
- **Run Method**: `@workflow.run` identifies the main workflow execution method

### Worker Process
- **Task Queue Polling**: Workers poll specific task queues for work
- **Workflow Registration**: Workers must register workflow classes they can execute
- **Concurrent Execution**: Workers can handle multiple workflow instances simultaneously

### Workflow Execution
- **Unique Workflow ID**: Each workflow execution has a unique identifier
- **Task Queue Routing**: Workflows are routed to workers via task queues
- **Result Handling**: Workflow results can be retrieved synchronously
