# Temporal Workflow Worker Failure Scenarios

This document explains two common failure scenarios in Temporal workflow execution and how the system handles them gracefully. Understanding these scenarios is crucial for building resilient Temporal applications.

## Scenario 1: No Workflow Worker Available

### Description

This scenario occurs when a workflow execution is started, but no worker is running to process the workflow tasks. This is common during:
- Initial application deployment before workers are started
- Worker downtime during maintenance or crashes
- Configuration mismatches between starter and worker task queues

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Starter
    participant TS as Temporal Service
    participant W as Workflow Worker (Not Running)
    
    Note over S,W: Worker is not running or not connected
    
    S->>+TS: StartWorkflowExecution<br/>(HelloWorldWorkflow, TaskQueue: hello-world-task-queue, ID: hello-world-workflow-001, Input:"Temporal")
    TS->>TS: Create workflow execution<br/>State: RUNNING
    TS-->>-S: Ack (Workflow started)
    
    Note over TS: Workflow execution created but no tasks dispatched yet
    
    
    loop Once a minute
        S->>+TS: long-poll GetResult<br/>
    end
    
    Note over TS: Workflow task is persisted in hello-world-task-queue<br/>Workflow execution stays in RUNNING state
        
    Note over S,W: Workflow execution persists in Temporal<br/>Ready to be processed when worker becomes available
```

### Temporal Behavior

**What Happens:**
1. **Workflow Creation**: The workflow execution is successfully created and stored in Temporal
2. **Task Queuing**: Workflow tasks wait in the task queue but aren't dispatched (no workers available)
3. **State Persistence**: The workflow remains in `RUNNING` state indefinitely if timeout is not specified or explictly canceled or terminated
4. **Client Timeout**: The starter may timeout (if configured) waiting for results, but the workflow persists. It is also possible to wait for result from a different process than started the workflow.

**Key Points:**
- **No Data Loss**: The workflow execution and its state are safely stored
- **Automatic Recovery**: When a worker becomes available, it will immediately pick up pending tasks
- **Client Flexibility**: Clients can reconnect later to get results
- **No Task Expiration**: Workflow tasks don't expire (the whole workfow can timeout if configured)

### Recovery

When a worker becomes available:

    participant S as New Starter/Client
    participant TS as Temporal Service  
    participant W as Workflow Worker (Now Running)
    
    Note over W: Worker starts and connects
    
    W->>+TS: long-poll PollWorkflowTaskQueue<br/>(hello-world-task-queue)
    
    Note over TS: Pending workflow task available
    
    TS->>+W: WorkflowTask<br/>(HelloWorldWorkflow, ID: hello-world-workflow-001, Input:"Temporal")
    W->>W: Execute HelloWorldWorkflow.run("Temporal")
    W->>W: return "Hello Temporal!"
    W-->>-TS: CompleteWorkflowTask(Commands:[<br/>CompleteWorkflowExecution(Result:"Hello Temporal!")<br/>])
    
    TS->>TS: Update workflow state: COMPLETED
    TS-->>-W: Task completed successfully
    
    Note over S: Client can now retrieve result
    S->>+TS: GetResult (hello-world-workflow-001)
    TS-->>-S: Return result: "Hello Temporal!"
```

## Scenario 2: Workflow Worker Crashes During Task Processing

### Description

This scenario occurs when a worker crashes, becomes unresponsive, or loses connection while processing a workflow task. This can happen due to:
- Application crashes or bugs
- Network connectivity issues  
- Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)
- Infrastructure failures

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

    participant S as Starter
    participant TS as Temporal Service
    participant W as Workflow Worker
    
    Note over S,W: Normal workflow execution begins
    
    S->>+TS: StartWorkflowExecution<br/>(HelloWorldWorkflow, TaskQueue: hello-world-task-queue, ID: hello-world-workflow-002, Input:"Temporal")
    TS-->>-S: Ack
    
    W->>+TS: long-poll PollWorkflowTaskQueue<br/>(hello-world-task-queue)
    TS->>+W: WorkflowTask<br/>(HelloWorldWorkflow, ID: hello-world-workflow-002, Input:"Temporal")
    
    Note over W: Worker starts processing
    W->>W: Execute HelloWorldWorkflow.run("Temporal")

    end
    
    Note over TS: Task timeout timer running<br/>(default: 10 seconds for workflow tasks, exponential backoff in case of repeated failures)

        participant W2 as Workflow Worker (Recovered)
        W2->>+TS: long-poll PollWorkflowTaskQueue<br/>(hello-world-task-queue)
        
        TS->>+W2: WorkflowTask<br/>(HelloWorldWorkflow, ID: hello-world-workflow-002, Input:"Temporal")<br/>Attempt: 2
        
        W2->>W2: Execute HelloWorldWorkflow.run("Temporal")
        W2->>W2: return "Hello Temporal!"
        W2-->>-TS: CompleteWorkflowTask(Commands:[<br/>CompleteWorkflowExecution(Result:"Hello Temporal!")<br/>])
        
        TS->>TS: Update workflow state: COMPLETED
        TS-->>-W2: Task completed successfully
    end
    
    S->>+TS: long-poll GetResult
    TS-->>-S: Return result: "Hello Temporal!"
    
    Note over S,W2: Workflow completed successfully<br/>despite worker crash
```

### Temporal Behavior

**What Happens:**
1. **Task Assignment**: Worker receives and starts processing the workflow task
2. **Worker Failure**: Worker crashes/disconnects during task processing
3. **Timeout Detection**: Temporal detects the failure via task timeout (default: 10 seconds)
4. **Task Retry**: A new workflow task is created
5. **Task Redelivered**: A different workflow woker picks up the task
6. **Successful Completion**: Workflow completes normally

**Key Points:**
- **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention required
- **At-Most-Once Execution**: From an external observer a workflow is executed exactly once
- **Workflow Task Timeout**: Configurable timeout for detecting worker failures. It is important to recogize that this timeout only affects retries of workfow tasks and is not related to the ovearll workflow timeout. It is not recommended to increase this timeout in the majority of cases.

### Task Timeout Configuration

You can configure workflow task timeouts:

```python
# In the starter
handle = await client.start_workflow(
    HelloWorldWorkflow.run,
    name_input,
    id=workflow_id,
    task_queue="hello-world-task-queue",
    task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),  # Custom timeout
)
```
