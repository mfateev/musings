# Cursor Rules for Temporal.io Documentation Repository

This repository contains documentation and explanations of Temporal.io concepts, patterns, and best practices.

## Context and Terminology

- **Workflows, Activities, Services**: By default, all references to these terms refer to Temporal concepts unless explicitly stated otherwise
- **Workflow**: A Temporal Workflow function that defines the orchestration logic
- **Activity**: A Temporal Activity function that performs a single, well-defined action
- **Service**: Typically refers to Temporal Services or Worker Services in the Temporal ecosystem

## Repository Purpose

This repository focuses on:
- Explaining Temporal.io concepts and patterns
- Providing documentation for Temporal workflows and activities
- Demonstrating best practices for Temporal application development
- Creating examples and tutorials for Temporal.io usage

## Code and Content Guidelines

- When discussing distributed systems concepts, assume Temporal context unless specified
- Use Temporal terminology consistently throughout documentation
- Examples should demonstrate Temporal SDK usage and patterns
- Focus on practical, real-world Temporal use cases
- Maintain clarity between Temporal-specific concepts and general distributed systems concepts

## Temporal-Specific Context

- Assume familiarity with Temporal's execution model (deterministic workflows, replay, etc.)
- Reference Temporal SDK features and capabilities
- Consider Temporal's guarantees (reliability, scalability, visibility)
- Keep in mind Temporal's workflow and activity lifecycle management
